## Project Story  


### Inspiration  


Every day, women around the world face situations where they feel uneasy or unsafe, such as walking alone at night or taking a taxi with a stranger. While these scenarios might not warrant contacting emergency services, the **fear** can still be overwhelming. SafeCall AI was inspired by the need for a simple yet effective tool to empower women in such situations, leveraging AI to create a sense of safety and control.  


### What It Does  


SafeCall AI simulates realistic phone calls using AI-generated voices that impersonate family members or significant others.  


- **Quick Activation:** Users can trigger a fake phone call to deter potential threats.  


- **AI-Powered Conversations:** Powered by Google Gemini, the app generates natural and convincing dialogues.  


- **Customizable Profiles:** Users can set up predefined callers,including partner or family members, and personalize scenarios to make the interactions more believable.


- **Future Features:** Planned enhancements include automatic emergency detection, offline functionality, and safe word detection.  


### How We Built It  


- **Frontend:** Developed using Flutter for a responsive and seamless cross-platform experience.  


- **Backend:** Integrated with Google Gemini API for natural language processing and flutter text to speech for voice synthesis.  


### Challenges We Ran Into  


- Crafting realistic and contextually appropriate conversations for diverse scenarios—this was addressed by fine-tuning the Gemini model to suit our needs.


- Minimizing latency to ensure real-time responses during fake calls—achieved by leveraging the seamless integration between Google products, such as Gemini and Flutter.


### Accomplishments That We’re Proud Of  


- Building a working prototype with AI-powered fake phone call functionality.  


- Successfully integrating Google Gemini for realistic voice and conversation generation.  


- Creating a user-friendly interface that prioritizes accessibility and ease of use.  


- **Addressing a significant real-world safety concern faced by women.**  


### What We Learned  


- Understanding the importance of designing solutions that prioritize user safety and meet real-world needs with empathy.


- Mastering Google Gemini’s advanced capabilities for NLP and learning how to effectively develop with Flutter for a smooth user experience.


- Overcoming the complexities of creating believable and natural conversations for critical safety scenarios.


### What's Next for SafeCall AI  


- **Emergency Detection:** AI-based recognition of distress signals and unusual situations, like route deviations.  


- **Offline Functionality:** Support for offline use with local models or pre-recorded scripts.  


- **Location Integration:** Real-time location sharing with trusted contacts during fake calls via Google Maps.  


- **Safe Words:** Detection of user-designated safe words to signal danger in emergencies.  


- **Enhanced Customization:** Expanded options for creating multiple caller personas and customizing conversations.  


- **Multilingual Support:** Enabling fake calls in multiple languages to make the app more inclusive.
